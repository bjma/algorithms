# CSE 102: Intro to Algorithm Analysis & Design
This repository is used for notes on algorithm design strategies and some common algorithms.

It also includes code written in Python for each algorithm, but please note that I don't run any of my code so they might not actually run.

I think the biggest thing to take away from the course is how many different strategies there are to solve algorithm problems that doesn't use brute force. This is especially useful for technical interview questions for software engineering positions.
