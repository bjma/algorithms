# CSE 102: Intro to Algorithm Analysis & Design
> **Taken with**: David Helmbold, Spring 2020

This repository is used for notes on algorithm design strategies and some common algorithms.

It also includes code written in Python for each algorithm, but please note that I don't run any of my code so they might not actually run. I chose Python because it's probably the most readable language for concepts like these.

I think the biggest thing to take away from the course is how many different strategies there are to solve algorithm problems that doesn't use brute force. This is especially useful for technical interview questions for software engineering positions.

## Dear David, Vishal (vkrish), Siman, & Zekun
This repo won't contain any homework solutions, so don't bother looking for any answers here! This is meant as a supplemental pseudo-textbook for students.
